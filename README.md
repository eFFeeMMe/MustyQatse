# Mustyqatse

MustyQatse is a game inspired by Peggle but not quite like it.

## How to play

First you have to navigate through the very cool and dysfunctional game menu. It's not easy, so it must be very rewarding already.

Get to the actual level and you're greeted by a bunch of balls. And lines. Marvel at the balls and lines.

There's a ball launcher thing at the top. There's a ball repulsor at the bottom. We don't know why the top thing is spitting balls at the bottom thing. It may be easier, however, to understand why the thing at the bottom is repulsed by them. Primal forces are at play here.

Either way, spit out enough balls, see them fade into the inscrutable void, and the game will end. It will have been very satisfying, and you will have learned a great deal. A final lesson will be imparted, picked at random from a \[\] of ultimate lessons, and you'll be allowed to leave, greatly enriched.
